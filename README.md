# Godot 2D Platformer Redux


## Description

This project uses one of godot's starter kits, then using heartbeast RPG statemachine logic, and some of my own logic intwined. I plan on making this my own custom template for all to use, inconjuction with my own assets, but for now i will use Itch.io assets until further notice.

## Features

* Player
  * Hardcoded statemachine
  * Using animated Sprite with Animation player (easy for multiple sprite sheets while yet wanting a state machine)
  * Simple Attack logic with hitbox (soon a hurtbox will be made)
 
* Enemy
  * Simple hurtbox
  * simple animations (not same as player - will fix)
  * no movement logic/AI

* Levels
  * Using Tilemaps
  * Different Layers
  * not much else to say for this lol
